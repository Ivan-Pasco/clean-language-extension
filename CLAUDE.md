# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Rust-based compiler for Clean Language, a type-safe programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. Clean Language combines JavaScript-like readability with Rust-like safety features.

Language characteristics are described in the [Language Specification](./Language-Specification.md). if you find something that is not described in the specification, propose a change to the specification before implementing it. When something is added you need to update the specification.

## Platform Architecture

The runtime platform architecture is documented in [platform-architecture/](./platform-architecture/README.md). This includes:

- **[Host Bridge Specification](./platform-architecture/HOST_BRIDGE.md)** - All portable host functions (console, math, string, database, file I/O, HTTP client, crypto)
- **[Memory Model](./platform-architecture/MEMORY_MODEL.md)** - WASM memory layout, string format, bump allocator
- **[Server Extensions](./platform-architecture/SERVER_EXTENSIONS.md)** - HTTP server-specific functions (routing, request context, auth)
- **[Implementing a New Host](./platform-architecture/IMPLEMENTING_HOST.md)** - Guide for building new runtime implementations

When modifying host functions or adding new ones, always update the platform architecture documentation.

cargo run --bin debug_parser -- file.clean
```

### Package Management
```bash

# Add a dependency
cargo run --bin clean-language-compiler package add package-name

# Install dependencies
cargo run --bin clean-language-compiler package install
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Parser** (`src/parser/`): Pest-based parser with error recovery
- Uses `grammar.pest` for grammar rules
- Supports classes, functions, async operations, and inheritance
- Error recovery mode for better debugging

**Semantic Analysis** (`src/semantic/`): Type checking and validation
- Type inference and constraint solving
- Scope management for variables and functions
- Class inheritance validation

**Code Generation** (`src/codegen/`): WebAssembly output
- Generates WASM using `wasm-encoder`
- Memory management and string pooling
- Type-specific instruction generation

**Runtime** (`src/runtime/`): Async and I/O operations
- Async task scheduling
- File I/O operations
- HTTP client functionality

**Standard Library** (`src/stdlib/`): Built-in functions
- Array operations, math functions, string manipulation
- Memory management utilities
- Type conversion functions

### Key Features

**Type System**: Strong static typing with inference
- Primitive types: `integer`, `number`, `string`, `boolean`
- Complex types: `Array<T>`, `Matrix<T>`
- Class inheritance with `base()` constructor calls

**WebAssembly Target**: All code compiles to WASM
- Memory-safe execution
- Portable across platforms
- Integration with existing WASM toolchain

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery
- Parse errors with recovery suggestions
- Semantic analysis errors with context
- Runtime error propagation with `onError` syntax

## Testing Strategy

The project uses multiple testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing (`cargo test`)
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end compilation testing (`tests/integration_tests.rs`)
3. **Parser Tests**: Grammar and parsing validation (`tests/parser_tests/`)
4. **Standard Library Tests**: Built-in function verification (`tests/stdlib_tests.rs`)

## Development Workflow

When implementing new features:

1. Update grammar in `src/parser/grammar.pest` if needed
2. Extend AST definitions in `src/ast/mod.rs`
3. Add parsing logic in appropriate `src/parser/` files
4. Implement semantic analysis in `src/semantic/`
5. Add code generation in `src/codegen/`
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Update examples and documentation
8. Update the language specification in `Language-Specification.md`
9. when you find an error while compiling, add it to the `TASKS.md` file.
10. when a test fails, check if the test is correct and has the right syntax according to the Language-Specification.md, if it is wrong, fix the test. once the test is fixed if it still fails add the needed changes to the TASKS.md file.

## File Extensions

- `.cln`: Clean Language source files
- `.wasm`: Compiled WebAssembly output
- `package.clean.toml`: Package manifest files

## Development Rules and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **NO PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS**: Never create placeholder functions that return dummy values (like `return 0`, `return false`, etc.). All functions must be fully implemented and functional.

2. **NO FALLBACK IMPLEMENTATIONS**: Avoid temporary "simplified" implementations that don't provide the actual functionality. Each function should work as intended.

3. **WORKING CODE ONLY**: All code must be production-ready and functional. If a feature cannot be fully implemented immediately, document it as a task rather than implementing a stub.

### Task Management

1. **TASKS.md TRACKING**: When discovering any error, bug, or incomplete implementation:
   - Add it as a new task in TASKS.md with appropriate priority level
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Describe the exact issue and expected behavior

2. **TASK COMPLETION UPDATES**: When completing any task:
   - Mark the task as completed in TASKS.md
   - Update the status and add completion notes
   - Include any relevant technical details about the solution

3. **TASK PRIORITIZATION**: Follow the existing priority system in TASKS.md:
   - 🔴 CRITICAL: Core functionality issues that break the compiler
   - 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH: Important features with significant impact
   - 🟢 LOW: Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations

### Error Handling Philosophy

- Fix the root cause, not the symptoms
- Maintain functional implementations while fixing underlying issues
- Document complex issues that require multi-step solutions
- Always prefer proper fixes over workarounds
- our goal is to reach 100% accuracy on the whole compile and excecution  process. There should be no errors, we wont stop until reaching it. The process should include the testing of all files in the tests folder
- all test files should be inside tests/cln folder inside a logical  category, all the tests compiled from tests/cln folder should be compiled to tests/output folder. before creating a new test file read the tests in the category to verify if there is already a test for it, and if you need to create a new one save it in the same folder.
- for research about rust compilers or pest parser use context7
